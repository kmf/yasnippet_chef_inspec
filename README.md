Some Chef and InSpec Snippets ported over from my Vim Snipmate Repo for Emacs.

Clone this `repo`  and copy the directories in place 

*tested on Doom Emacs*

```
~/.doom.d/snippets/chef-mode
~/.doom.d/snippets/inspec-mode
~/.doom.d/snippets/ruby-mode
```

These where converted using the `snipmate_to_yas` gem.
